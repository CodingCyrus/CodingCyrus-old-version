            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p lang="en-us">Hello World! My name is Cyrus Chun, I am currently a student in the Masters of Science in Software Development program 
                at Boston University based out of Los Angeles, California. Prior to moving to Los Angeles, I worked as a Brand Marketing Executive at a Global FMCG company after graduating from Waseda University in Japan with a BA in Political Economics of International Development.
               After taking several coding courses online in Python and Java, I realized I had a passion to learn new technologies but also create innovative solutions through software development.
               During my time at BU, my goal is to become a Android Mobile Developer in addition to developing the latest skills in Full Stack Java Development through pursuing internships and building personal projects.
            </p>

            <h3>Who is Cyrus?</h3>
            <p lang="en-us">Cyrus was born in Bangkok, Thailand in 1996 to Japanese and Korean parents. He has lived in Bangkok, Thailand for 4 years after which he lived in Los Angeles, USA for 11 years and Tokyo, Japan for 10 years. 
            A born digital nomad, Cyrus is also a native bilingual speaker in English and Japanese but hopes to one day be a native multi-lingual in advanced programming languages. 
            Prior to Covid-19, Cyrus was a avid traveller having visited over +20 countries. But after enrolling in Boston University in Fall 2021, he likes to spend most of his time indoors exploring the world of the internet.
